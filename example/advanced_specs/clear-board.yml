Title: Clear Board
Story: |-
  As a codebreaker
  I want a clear board with a new code
  In order to start making guesses on it
Scenarios:
  Start board:
  - Given even boards
  - When I `request` a clear `board` in my new game
  - Then the first board is added with the $animal
  Start colored board:
  - Given even boards
  - When I `request` a clear `board` in my new game
  - Then the $nth board is added with the $color

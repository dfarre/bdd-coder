Title: New Game
Story: |-
  As a codebreaker
  I want to start a new Mastermind game of B boards of G guesses
  In order to play
Scenarios:
  Even boards:
  - When I request a new `game` with $n boards
  - Then a game of $kind is created with boards of $guess_count guesses
  Odd boards:
  - When I request a new `game` with $n boards
  - Then I get a 400 response saying it must be even
  - And the number of boards is indeed odd

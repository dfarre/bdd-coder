Title: New Game

Story: |-
  As a codebreaker
  I want to start a new Mastermind game of B boards of G guesses
  In order to play

Fixtures:
  - player-alice

Scenarios:
  Odd boards:
      - When I request a new `game` with an odd number of boards
      - Then I get a 400 response saying it must be even
  Even boards:
      - When I request a new `game` with an even number of boards
      - Then a game is created with boards of "12" guesses

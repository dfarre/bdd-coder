Title: New Game

Story: |-
  As a codebreaker
  I want to start a new Mastermind game of B boards of G guesses
  In order to play and have fun

Scenarios:
  Even boards:
      - Given new player joins
      - When I request a new `game` with an even number of boards
      - Then a game is created with boards of "12" guesses
  Funny boards:
      - Given new player joins
      - Then class hierarchy has changed
  More boards:
      - Given new player joins
      - Then she is welcome

# Extra class atributes ignored in patch
Extra name:
  - '1'
  - '2'
